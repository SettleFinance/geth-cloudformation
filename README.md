## Features


## Set up
The setup for Geth CloudFormation is very simple. We try to limit the acceptable instances to Geth compatible instances. Just select the size of instance you want and the resiliency (the number of instances). The stack will spin everything up and give you a URL to check as your Geth cluster syncs with the Ethereum chain.
